/**
 * Three patches on net.minecraft.client.render.Camera:
 *
 *  1. clipToSpace(F) — when CameraClip is on, return the unclipped distance
 *     so the camera passes through walls.
 *
 *  2. The argument to clipToSpace inside update() — swap in the user's custom
 *     distance via @ModifyArg.
 *
 *  3. update() — apply freelook BEFORE moveBy() runs. This is the key detail:
 *     moveBy uses this.rotation (the Quaternionf) to figure out which way is
 *     "back" when shifting the camera away from the player. If we override
 *     rotation BEFORE moveBy, the camera ends up at playerEyes + (-freelookForward
 *     * distance) — i.e. orbiting the player using the freelook angle, with
 *     the player centered in view.
 *
 *     We inject at the call to clipToSpace inside the third-person block. By
 *     that point setPos() has placed us at the player's eyes; we then overwrite
 *     rotation, and the immediately-following moveBy(-clipToSpace(...)) shifts
 *     the camera "back" along the freelook direction.
