/**
 * Shared scan of "SUPPLIES RECEIVED" armor stands for Kuudra Phase 1.
 *
 * Multiple features (PearlWaypoints, PileWaypoints, ...) need to know which
 * supply piles have already been deposited. Rather than each one doing its
 * own per-tick world entity scan, this object owns one scan and exposes the
 * results.
 *
 * Scan runs every 10 client ticks (~0.5s) when in Kuudra Phase 1, and
 * matches armor stands within 6 blocks of any [Place] location whose name
 * contains "SUPPLIES RECEIVED" (case-insensitive, color codes stripped).
 *
 * Results are cleared:
 *  - On world disconnect/join
 *  - Whenever Phase 1 is not active (so stale data doesn't leak between runs)
